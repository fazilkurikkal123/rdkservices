#RDK services L2 Tests #

## How to run locally ##

Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) and docker:

##### Ubuntu #####

```shell script
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install docker.io
```

##### macOS #####

```shell script
brew install act
brew install --cask docker
```

Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Invoke the workflow:

```shell script
act -W .github/workflows/L2-tests.yml -s GITHUB_TOKEN=[token]

The tests will run without valgrid by default. If you want to run tests with valgrind also then you need to remove below condition at "Run unit tests with valgrind" step from the yml file.

    if: ${{ !env.ACT }}
```

`-r, --reuse` to reuse the container.

Get a bash shell in the container, if needed:

```shell script
docker ps
docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash
```

## FAQ ##

1. The commands to build and run tests are in [L2-tests.yml](../../.github/workflows/L2-tests.yml).
 For the queries on syntax please refer to the [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

2. External dependencies need to be mocked.
 For each external header, add one into the [l2tests.cmake](../../l2tests.cmake) (preserve the original path parts, if needed).
 For each external declaration, add one into the [mocks folder](../mocks).
 For the queries on mocks please refer to the [gMock Cookbook](http://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html).

3. For the queries on how to write tests please refer to the [GoogleTest Userâ€™s Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/).
 Common recommendations:
   - Tests should be fast.
   - Tests should be independent and repeatable.
   - Find the L2 usecase/logic from your plugin which you can test.  Isolate each use case from other use cases.
   - Implement the Arrange-Act-Assert patterns for each step in a use case.
     If two or more tests operate on similar data, use a test fixture.
     Use `ON_CALL` by default, and only use `EXPECT_CALL` when intend to verify that the call is made.

4. To add L2 tests for a RDK service
 Required steps:
   - Set plugin ON by default in [l2tests.cmake](../../l2tests.cmake)
  	  Example : set(PLUGIN_SYSTEMSERVICES ON)

   - Add required empty headers,definitions and mock files in [l2tests.cmake](../../l2tests.cmake) to pass compilation for the added plugin
   - Update yml file as well to enable the plugin.
      Example : -DPLUGIN_SYSTEMSERVICES=ON

   - Add new L2 test file for the plugin in folder rdkservices/L2Tests/tests with name Pluginname_L2tests
       Example : SystemServices_L2test.cpp

   - Add a class (with pluginname_L2tests as name) which inherits the mock class for getting all the mocks required by plugin.
       Example :class Systemservice_L2test : public L2TestMocks

   -  Add Test fixtures for each usecase.

5. To run L2 tests for specific suite (plugin)
    During test/code development, we often do not want to run all the tests. Instead, to save time, we can use the following method to run specified test suite(s).

 Required steps:
   - In yml file in the step where it runs the L2test binary RDKServiceL2test add the test suite name you want to run
   Example :
       a. If we want to run single suite
          RDKServicesL2test System (this is internally considered as 'System*' and gtest framework runs all tests added with suite name starting with 'System')
       b. If we want to run multiple suites
          RDKServicesL2test System Usb (this is internally considered as 'System*:Usb*' and gtest framework runs all tests added with suite name starting with 'System' and all tests with suite name starting with 'Usb')


  Note: TEST_COMPLETION_TIMEOUT specifies a time limit for completing the specified tests.  This can be increased/decreased by changing the value in  [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt).
